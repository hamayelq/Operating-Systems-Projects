Initializing arena:
...requested size 4096 bytes
...pagesize is 4096 bytes
...adjusting size with page boundaries
...adjusted size is 4096 bytes
...mapping arena with mmap()
...arena starts at 0x7fdd77bbf000
...arena ends at 0x7fdd77bc0000
...initializing header for initial free chunk
...header size is 32 bytes
size passed in: 32
Set new size
Set new is free
Set new fwd
Set new bwd
Header->size: 32
Header->fwd: 0x7fdd77bbf040
Header->bwd: (nil)
Header->is_free: 0
size passed in: 32
Going to next node (fwd)
Set new size
Set new is free
Set new fwd
Set new bwd
Freeing allocated memory:
...supplied pointer 0x7fdd77bbf020
...being careful with my pointer arithmetic and void pointer casting
...accessing chunk header at 0x7fdd77bbf000
...chunk of size 32
size passed in: 32
Destroying Arena:
...unmapping arena with munmap()
All tests passed!
