~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PROJECT 4 CHECKPOINT - Hamayel Qureshi & Mago Sheehy ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PROBLEM 2:

COMPLETE. There is a bug in our code where some threads will sometimes not run through completion. It will always complete at 
79 packages, and will /almost/ always complete all 80 packages. The program is also pretty fair, with the average no. of processed
packages per team being 20. Will come to office hours to sort out that bug later. THnx
