~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Problem 1 - Mago Sheehy & Hamayel Qureshi ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our solution entails four semaphores: stageSem, leaveStageSem, enterSem, and printSem. 

The primary semaphores being used to ensure fairness and protection of critical sections are stageSem and enterSem. 

stageSem allows four performers to be active at a time (it is initialized to 4). Each time a performer becomes active,
we have a call to sem_wait(&stageSem). The semaphore is 'posted' when the performer is done performing. 

For each active performer attempting to enter the stage, if they are the same type as the performers on stage, they are 
allowed to enter the stage (unless it is a soloist, which requires an empty stage), otherwise, . When a performer finishes performing,
a new performer is added to the set of active performers
